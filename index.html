I have moved this from an AWS s3 bucket to a github pages site, but the routing is all messed up
So some of my old resumes might have broken links, Im doing what I can to fix them, but digging around
github documentation for how to configure a AWS route 53 A record, seems to be a bit of a pain.

So things are a bit broken, I would worry more if I hadn't wrote a script to call the node pretty print
library im using and pretty print any tables I have right on my computer, making this site a bit redundant
for me. But i suppose its all good practice with github actions and pages.

Someday the routing might be fixed, but today is not that day. please forgive the inconvenience.
